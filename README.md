# This is a demonstration of my skills as a data analyst using an example dataset of video game sales from 1984 - 2014. 

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.

I cleaned the dataset and manipulate the data to get my goal of showcasing the top 30 selling North American Video Games for this time period
